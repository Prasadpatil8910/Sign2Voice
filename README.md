Built an end-to-end deep learning–based Sign Language to Speech system that translates sign gestures into natural multilingual voice output. Implemented a Seq2Seq model for gesture-to-text conversion, integrated IndicTrans2 for regional language translation, and utilized Indic Parler-TTS for realistic speech synthesis. Designed the pipeline for real-time processing, enabling inclusive communication across multiple Indian languages.
